# Project 

The New International Passports (NIP) project provides a proof of concept for dematerialized passports using blockchain technology through a secure and private blockchain network (this repository), a web application, a back-end server and an adapted architecture for decentralization. Through all those services, citizens, governments and customs will find appropriate solutions and interfaces for the passport of tomorrow.
